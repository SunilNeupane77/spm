    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    # Add any other necessary environment variables
