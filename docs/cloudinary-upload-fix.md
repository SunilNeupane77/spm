# Cloudinary Resource Upload Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve issues with Cloudinary resource uploads in the academic platform.

## Issues Fixed

1. **File Buffer Handling**
   - Fixed the file buffer processing in the `uploadToCloudinary` function to properly handle both Buffer and ArrayBuffer types
   - Added better error checking and reporting for buffer-related errors

2. **Resource Type Detection**
   - Improved resource type detection by using both MIME type and file extension
   - Added support for more file types in the detection logic
   - Updated the upload API route to set the proper resource type for Cloudinary

3. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error messaging with specific feedback for different types of upload failures
   - Added file size validation to prevent uploading files that exceed Cloudinary's limits

4. **CloudinaryImage Component**
   - Improved video handling with additional attributes for better playback
   - Enhanced document/file preview with better file type detection and display
   - Added clickable document links that open the file in a new tab

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Try uploading different file types (images, documents, videos)
2. Check the Cloudinary dashboard to confirm uploads
3. Verify the resources display correctly in the application

## Additional Documentation

- Added `docs/cloudinary-troubleshooting.md` with common issues and solutions
- Updated existing documentation to reflect the changes

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
1. Client-side file validation and compression
2. Progress indicators during uploads
3. Resumable uploads for large files
4. Migration utility to move existing files to Cloudinary
