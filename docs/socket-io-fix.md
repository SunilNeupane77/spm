# Socket.IO Integration Fix Guide

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the Socket.IO connection issues in the application.

## Problem Identified

The error `TypeError: (0 , __TURBOPACK__imported__module__$5b$project$5d2f$node_modules$2f$socket$2e$io$2d$client$2f$index$2e$js__$5b$app$2d$client$5d$__$28$ecmascript$29$__.io) is not a function` occurred because:

1. Socket.IO client was incorrectly imported using named import instead of default import
2. There were issues with the socket API route implementation
3. The socket initialization approach was not compatible with Next.js 

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Created Socket Client Module

Created a reusable socket client module (`/lib/socket.js`) that provides:
- Proper socket initialization with the correct import syntax
- Helper functions for getting, initializing, and closing socket connections
- Client-side only execution with 'use client' directive

### 2. Restructured Socket Server Code

- Created a dedicated socket middleware (`/lib/socketMiddleware.js`)
- Moved all event handlers and business logic into the middleware
- Fixed the Socket API route to use the middleware
- Eliminated duplicate code and improved error handling

### 3. Updated Real-time Collaboration Code

- Updated references to use the new socket module
- Fixed socket reference handling throughout the codebase
- Added proper cleanup for socket connections

### 4. Added Debugging Tools

- Created a debug API endpoint (`/api/debug/socket`) to check socket server status
- Added a visual debug page (`/debug/socket`) for testing socket connections
- Included comprehensive error handling and logging

## How to Test the Fix

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/debug/socket` to verify socket connections
3. Check if the socket connection status shows "connected"
4. Use the "Send Test Event" button to test event emission
5. Join a test mindmap room to verify room functionality

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Better code organization**: Socket logic is now properly separated
2. **Improved reliability**: Connection handling is more robust
3. **Enhanced debugging**: New tools make it easier to diagnose issues
4. **Simplified maintenance**: Code is now more modular and easier to update
